# go2dgame

Experiments with go-gl and game development in Go.

### introduction
After watching the [talk from GopherCon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiv1JOfMjm0)
about improvements with GC in Go 1.5, I become interested in making games in Go.

This project will contain several experiments using go-gl to make 2D games. Since
I am new to OpenGL, go-gl, and game development in general, this may not
be a great resource for your own learning but maybe you'll find helpful code
examples.

I'm grateful to the people who made go-gl and OpenGL. I am impressed with the
amount of work people have contributed to these efforts over the years.
