# go2dgame

## experimenting with go-gl and go game development

### introduction
After watching the [talk from GopherCon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiv1JOfMjm0)
about improvements with GC in Go 1.5 and got really interested in making games in Go.

This project is all about me learning how to use go-gl to make games. Most of
the code will be experimenting with the libraries.

## getting started
`go get https://github.com/buwilliams/go2dgame.git`
